# build-a-formik-form
Activity to create a login form with validation using Formik.

Formik is a small library that can help you with the three most annoying aspects of creating forms in React:

Getting values in and out of the form state
Validation and error messages
Handling form submission
By collecting all of the above in one place, Formik can keep things organized, making testing, refactoring, and reasoning your forms much easier.

In this activity, you will be using npm to install React, Formik, and any other required libraries. This is different from the way youâ€™ve been using React so far.

HOW TO INSTALL & RUN:
Download the project starter files Links to an external site.. These files include: 
public/index.html (this is where your React app will be loaded inside the root element)
src/App.js (this is the main component of your React application. This is where most of your code will go)
Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files)
Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.
